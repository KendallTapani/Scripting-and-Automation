# Scripting and Automation

This Repo is meant to document my Skills using Powershell for scripting and automation.

## *** Sysadmin Scripting with python
Using my virtual system on VMware, I'm creating python scripts to automate the following:
- System Diagnostic monitoring, including resource consumption and log monitoring, creating alerts for any suspicious events or trends.
- Software Version Tracker, creating alerts for unpatched operating systems and software.


## ***** Sysadmin Scripting with Powershell
Using my Virtual system on VMware, I am integrating the following powershell scripts to:
- Automate User onboarding, including new user creation across systems, configuring permissions and access levels based on specified roles.
- Access Audit tool, to regularly scan for changed permissions, and alert any unauthorized permission changes
- Network and firewall configuration management
- Snapshot management with the powershell and VMware integration

## Personal Device Scripting
Here is a list of scripts on my personal computer:

#### 1. Ram clear: 
When I need to run a bunch of VMs on my laptop, I use a shortcut to clear all noncritical processes and services, usually freeing up a couple extra GBs of ram.
Also works for better gaming performance.


#### 2. Job Searching Automation
My fingers were getting tired typing my info into job search websites, so I made a couple Powershell and ahk scripts to save time.
