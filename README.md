# Scripting and Automation

This Repo is meant to document my Skills using Powershell for scripting and automation. I've included tools built from scratch, automated shortcuts and scripts, made to do repetitive tasks on my Personal PC. If you scroll through this, you'll see screenshots of all the projects here in working.

## *** Sysadmin Scripting with python
Using my virtual system on VMware, I'm creating python scripts to automate the following:
- System Diagnostic monitoring, including resource consumption and log monitoring, creating alerts for any suspicious events or trends.
- Software Version Tracker, creating alerts for unpatched operating systems and software.


## ***** Sysadmin Scripting with Powershell
Using my Virtual system on VMware, I am integrating the following powershell scripts to:
- Automate User onboarding, including new user creation across systems, configuring permissions and access levels based on specified roles.
- Access Audit tool, to regularly scan for changed permissions, and alert any unauthorized permission changes
- Network and firewall configuration management
- Snapshot management with the powershell and VMware integration

## Personal Device Scripting

Here is a list of scripts on my personal computer:
1. Ram clear:
When I need to run a bunch of VMs on my laptop, I use a shortcut to clear all noncritical processes and services, usually freeing up a couple extra GBs of ram.
Also works for better gaming performance.

## Job Searching Automation

My fingers were getting tired typing my info into job search websites, so I made a couple Powershell and ahk scripts to save 90% of my time applying for cool jobs. Heres what all the files in the JobSearch folder do..

1. Open all the relevant job sites I use to apply.
2. Open my email, start writing a new email, and paste my template into the email, ready to send
3. Open a page with all my resume info
4. Map specific information from a .txt file, to hotkeys, mapped to numbers. This types the info in and tabs, since they are hotkey numbers, I use the keypad to type in my name, email, phone number, address, etc. All the sites are different, and I would rather paste the info myself, than look through an automated fill in for mistakes. Its not actually saving any time making a python script to read the sites.
